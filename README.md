- The code is hosted on [gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/).  
- **Do you use a version control workflow** *(such as [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [centralized](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/centralized-workflow), [feature-branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow), etc)*?

## Support and Optimization
It's important to recognize the difference between ["support" and "optimization"](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/). You should do your best to support as many environments as possible while simultaneously optimizing for the environments that make the most sense for your business and users. 

- **What browsers are you *optimizing* for?** 
- **What devices are you *optimizing* for?** 
- **Are you using a [graded browser support](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Graded-Browser-Support) system?**
- **Are there specific components that require [more specific grading](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html)?** 

-----------

## Localization
- **Is your website served in different languages?** If so, what considerations do you need to address when localizing for other languages?

-----------

## Deployment/Integration
- **How is your front-end code integrated into a production environment?**

-----------

## Documentation
- **Are you using a [pattern library tool](http://styleguides.io/tools.html) to document your front-end architecture?**
- **Where does your documentation live?** What are the links to the documentation?
- **Who's responsible for maintaining and governing the documentation?**
- **What happens when the guidelines are updated?**
